# üßæ Alpha Restaurant SQL Schema

This project defines the complete SQL schema and data operation logic for the **Alpha Restaurant** database. It includes table definitions, data types, insert/update/query functions, and views.

The structure is modular, with each entity (e.g., branches, customers, employees) having its own dedicated SQL files for better maintainability.
